## Critical Dependencies & Blockers

### External Dependencies
1. **Google OAuth Setup** - Requires Google Cloud Console configuration
2. **Groq API Access** - Ensure sufficient API limits for production
3. **Firebase Configuration** - Production Firestore setup and security rules
4. **Domain & SSL** - Production deployment requirements

### Technical Blockers
1. **Gmail API Rate Limits** - May need to implement intelligent batching
2. **AI Token Costs** - Monitor and optimize Groq usage for cost efficiency
3. **Real-time Scaling** - WebSocket connection limits and load balancing
4. **Data Privacy** - Ensure compliance with email privacy regulations

## Risk Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Gmail API Integration Complexity** - Start with simple read/send, expand gradually
2. **AI Cost Management** - Implement usage monitoring and optimization early
3. **Real-time Performance** - Use efficient WebSocket libraries and connection pooling
4. **User Data Security** - Implement encryption and audit trails from day one

### Contingency Plans
1. **Groq API Issues** - Have OpenAI GPT-4o as backup LLM
2. **Gmail API Limits** - Implement intelligent caching and batching
3. **Performance Issues** - Use Redis for caching and background processing
4. **Security Concerns** - Regular security audits and compliance checks
