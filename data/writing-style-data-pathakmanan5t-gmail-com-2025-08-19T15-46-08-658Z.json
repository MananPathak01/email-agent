My name is Manan Pathak, and I am\ninterested in applying for the Master of Engineering (MEng) program in\nComputer Science at the University of Waterloo. I noticed on the program's\nwebsite that it offers start dates in spring, fall, and winter. However, I\nwas wondering if there are any available intakes earlier than the fall\nsession next year and if applications for those sessions are still open. I am highly motivated to begin the program as soon as possible, and I would\ngreatly appreciate any guidance or suggestions you can offer regarding this\nmatter. Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response. Best regards,\nManan Pathak",
