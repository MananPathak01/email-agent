## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Provider Email Integration

**User Story:** As a business professional, I want to connect multiple email accounts (Gmail, Outlook) to the system, so that I can manage all my email communications through a single AI-powered interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user navigates to the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display all connected email accounts with provider icons (Gmail, Outlook)
2. WHEN a user clicks "Connect Email Account" THEN the system SHALL initiate OAuth flow for the selected provider
3. WHEN OAuth is completed successfully THEN the system SHALL store encrypted tokens and display the connected account
4. IF a user tries to connect the same email twice THEN the system SHALL update the existing connection instead of creating duplicates
5. WHEN an email account is connected THEN the system SHALL immediately begin the initial learning process

### Requirement 2: Real-Time Email Monitoring

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to detect new emails instantly, so that AI-generated responses can be created without delay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new email arrives in any connected inbox THEN the system SHALL receive notification within 3 seconds via webhooks
2. WHEN a webhook notification is received THEN the system SHALL queue the email for AI processing within 100ms
3. WHEN webhook setup fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to polling every 30 seconds with user notification
4. WHEN processing an email THEN the system SHALL handle rate limits gracefully without losing emails
5. WHEN multiple emails arrive simultaneously THEN the system SHALL process them in parallel up to configured limits

### Requirement 3: AI Pattern Learning Engine

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to learn from my historical emails and response patterns, so that it can generate responses that match my communication style and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an email account is first connected THEN the system SHALL analyze the last 1000 sent emails to establish baseline patterns
2. WHEN analyzing historical emails THEN the system SHALL extract communication style, common phrases, and document attachment patterns
3. WHEN a workflow pattern is detected (e.g., onboarding sequence) THEN the system SHALL create a reusable workflow template
4. WHEN the user edits an AI-generated response THEN the system SHALL learn from the modifications for future improvements
5. WHEN similar email contexts are encountered THEN the system SHALL apply learned patterns with 80%+ accuracy

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Draft Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the AI to automatically create draft responses for incoming emails, so that I can quickly review and send replies without writing from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new email requires a response THEN the system SHALL generate a contextual draft within 10 seconds
2. WHEN generating a draft THEN the system SHALL include appropriate attachments based on learned patterns
3. WHEN a draft is created THEN the system SHALL save it directly to the email provider's draft folder
4. WHEN multiple response options are possible THEN the system SHALL generate the most likely response with confidence scoring
5. WHEN the email context is unclear THEN the system SHALL create a draft asking for clarification rather than guessing

### Requirement 5: Workflow Management Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and manage learned workflows, so that I can customize how the AI handles different types of email interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the workflows page THEN the system SHALL display all detected workflow patterns with usage statistics
2. WHEN viewing a workflow THEN the system SHALL show the trigger conditions, response templates, and associated documents
3. WHEN a user edits a workflow THEN the system SHALL update future AI responses to use the modified pattern
4. WHEN a user creates a custom workflow THEN the system SHALL apply it to matching future emails
5. WHEN workflows conflict THEN the system SHALL prioritize user-created workflows over AI-detected ones

### Requirement 6: Conversational AI Interface

**User Story:** As a user, I want to chat with the AI about my emails and workflows, so that I can get insights and make changes through natural language commands.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the chat interface THEN the system SHALL provide a conversational AI that understands email context
2. WHEN a user asks about email patterns THEN the AI SHALL provide insights with specific examples and statistics
3. WHEN a user requests workflow changes via chat THEN the AI SHALL implement the changes and confirm the updates
4. WHEN discussing specific emails THEN the AI SHALL reference actual email content while maintaining privacy
5. WHEN the user asks for email summaries THEN the AI SHALL provide concise, actionable summaries of recent activity

### Requirement 7: Security and Privacy
