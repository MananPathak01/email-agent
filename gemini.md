# Gemini AI Email Agent

## Project Overview

The AI-Powered Email Agent is an intelligent workflow automation system designed to transform traditional email management into a conversational AI experience. Instead of manually processing emails, users interact with an AI assistant that automatically detects, analyzes, and responds to email-based tasks with contextual awareness and workflow intelligence.

The core philosophy is **"Superhuman + ChatGPT + Context Memory,"** combining an efficient email interface, advanced natural language processing, and contextual memory to create a proactive email workflow automation platform.

## Key Features

*   **Multi-Provider Email Integration**: Connects to multiple Gmail accounts (with Outlook planned) via OAuth 2.0.
*   **AI-Powered Communication Profile**: Learns a user's individual writing style from their emails to generate authentic, personalized responses. It analyzes over 60 variables across 13 categories, including tone, formality, personality traits, and vocabulary.
*   **Intelligent Email Processing**:
    *   Automatically scans and classifies emails by importance, urgency, and category.
    *   Extracts key information, intent, and actionable items.
    *   Matches incoming emails with existing tasks and historical context.
*   **Context-Aware Response Generation**:
    *   Generates contextually appropriate replies using advanced AI models.
    *   Adapts tone and content based on the recipient, relationship, and situation.
    *   Suggests relevant document attachments automatically.
*   **Conversational Workflow Management**:
    *   Users interact with emails through a chat-style interface.
    *   The AI assistant summarizes emails and provides proactive suggestions.
    *   Handles natural language commands for managing workflows.
*   **Context-Aware Analysis**: A focused questionnaire helps the AI understand the user's role, industry, and communication goals, leading to more accurate and personalized analysis.
*   **Security and Privacy**: Features end-to-end encryption for email communication, secure token storage (AES-256), and data anonymization for AI training.

    *   **Embeddings**: OpenAI for pattern matching and similarity search.
*   **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication
*   **Email Integration**: Gmail API (with Microsoft Graph API for Outlook planned).

## System Architecture

The system is built with a scalable architecture that separates concerns into distinct layers:

1.  **Email Ingestion & Analysis**: Connects to Gmail accounts, scans for relevant emails, and uses AI to classify and extract key information.
2.  **Context Matching Engine**: Matches incoming emails with existing tasks and uses vector-based similarity search to find historical context.
3.  **AI-Powered Response Generation**: Generates contextually appropriate replies using the user's learned communication profile.
4.  **Conversational Workflow Management**: Provides a chat interface for users to interact with the AI, manage tasks, and get summaries.
5.  **Data Layer**: Uses Firebase/Firestore for data storage, a Vector Database for embeddings, and Redis for queuing background jobs.

The entire process is designed to be real-time, using webhooks to instantly detect and process new emails.
