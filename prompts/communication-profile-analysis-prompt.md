## Analysis Instructions

1. **Relationship Classification**: Use these categories: boss, colleague, direct_report, client, vendor, friend, family, unknown

2. **Confidence Scoring**: Base confidence on:
   - Sample size (more emails = higher confidence)
   - Consistency across samples
   - Clarity of patterns

3. **Feature Extraction**: For each feature, provide:
   - `value`: The actual measurement/classification
   - `confidence`: 0-1 score
   - `sampleSize`: Number of emails analyzed

4. **Scope Handling**: Consider different scopes:
   - per-user: Overall patterns
   - per-relationship: Patterns by relationship type
   - per-topic: Patterns by email subject/content
   - per-thread-position: Patterns by position in conversation

5. **Aggregation**: Use appropriate methods:
   - EWMA for time-weighted patterns
   - Mean Â± standard deviation for numeric values
   - Frequency distributions for categorical data

## Output Requirements

- Return ONLY valid JSON
- Include ALL categories from the specification
- Provide realistic confidence scores based on sample quality
- Use consistent relationship categories throughout
- Include specific examples where applicable
- Ensure all numeric values are reasonable and bounded

## Quality Checks

- Formality scores should be 1-10
- Percentages should sum to 100 where applicable
- Confidence scores should be 0-1
- Sample sizes should reflect actual email count
- Relationship classifications should be consistent
- Examples should be realistic and specific to the user's style
